A majority of Minneapolis City Council has pledged to dismantle the local police department, a significant move amid nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd's death last month.
Nine of the 13 councillors said a "new model of public safety" would be created in a city where law enforcement has been accused of racism.
Mayor Jacob Frey earlier opposed the move, drawing boos from the crowds.
Anti-racism rallies have been held after Floyd's death in police custody.
However, security measures across the country were lifted on Sunday as unrest started to ease.
Mr Floyd's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Houston, his home city before he moved to Minneapolis. The protests started after video emerged showing the 46-year-old African American pinned to the floor, with a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes.
Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting.
The nine councillors read a statement to hundreds of protesters on Sunday.
"We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe," City Council President Lisa Bender was quoted as saying. 
"Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period."
Ms Bender said details of the overhaul plan needed to be discussed further, adding that she would try to shift police funding towards community based strategies.
Meanwhile, councillor Alondra Cano tweeted that "a veto-proof majority" in the council had agreed that the city police department "is not reformable and that we're going to end the current policing system".

The process of setting up a new community-led body is likely to take several months, BBC North America correspondent Peter Bowes says.
The reform plan in Minneapolis also sets up what is likely to be a long and complicated debate over new ways of policing across the US. 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had already said he would divert money from the city's police department to social services.
"Defund the police" was a rallying cry during the latest street protests, that occasionally spilled into violence and looting.
"Defunding" advocates have for years been condemning what they describe as the aggressive militarised policing in the US.
They argue that police departments' budgets should be slashed and funds diverted to social programmes to avoid unnecessary confrontation and heal the racial divide.

George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd’s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying "I can’t breathe". He is pronounced dead later in hospital.

Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti.

Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting "I can’t breathe". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd’s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat.

President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet.  He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for "glorifying violence".

A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media.
Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence.

Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested.  Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest.

Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has strongly criticised President Donald Trump's handling of anti-racism protests, saying he has "drifted away" from the constitution.
The Republican, a former top military officer, is the latest to condemn Mr Trump's response, including his threats to use the army to quell rallies.
He said he would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in November's poll.
President Trump responded by calling Mr Powell "highly overrated".
Mr Powell, the only African American so far to have served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has joined a growing list of former top military officials to have launched scathing attacks on President Trump.
It comes amid days of nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May.
On Sunday, nine of 13 Minneapolis City Council members pledged in front of hundreds of protesters to dismantle the local police department and instead create "a new model of public safety that actually keeps our community safe".
Meanwhile, security measures across the US were lifted as unrest started to ease. New York ended its nearly week-long curfew, and Mr Trump said he was ordering the National Guard to start withdrawing from Washington DC.
Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Mr Powell said: "We have a constitution. And we have to follow that constitution. And the president has drifted away from it."
Referring to President Trump, the retired four-star general said: "He lies about things, and he gets away with it because people will not hold him accountable."
Mr Powell also said the president's rhetoric is a danger to American democracy and said, referring to this year's presidential election: "I certainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year."
He added: "I'm very close to Joe Biden in a social matter and political matter. I worked with him for 35, 40 years. And he is now the candidate, and I will be voting for him."
Mr Powell, who is seen as a moderate Republican, did not vote for Mr Trump in the 2016 poll.
In the interview, he also backed America's military leaders who had criticised Mr Trump in recent days. 
Gen Martin Dempsey, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman under Barack Obama, told ABC's The Week earlier on Sunday that the president's words had hurt relations between the US public and the military.
And former Defence Secretary James Mattis last week accused Mr Trump of deliberately stoking division, saying he "angry and appalled" by Mr Trump's handling of the protests.
On Twitter, Mr Trump said Colin Powell was "a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars", referring to the 1990-93 Gulf War and the US-led invasion in Iraq in 2003.
Mr Biden also took to Twitter to hit out at Mr Trump's handling of the protests, saying he had "callously used his [words as a president] to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart".
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CBS News' Face the Nation that she would like Mr Trump to "put tweeting aside for a little bit" and have a conversation with the American people.
"Not everyone is going to agree with any president, with this president, but you have to speak to every American, not just to those who might agree with you," she said.
The unrest in the US has largely been replaced by peaceful worldwide demonstrations, with Black Lives Matter protests staged in European nations on Sunday.
In the city of Bristol in the UK protesters tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader.
On Saturday, huge peaceful rallies took place across the US, including in Washington DC, Chicago and San Francisco. There was even a protest in the Texas town of Vidor, once infamous as a stronghold of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group.

New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect.
Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will have to provide an address where they will self-isolate and face fines of up to £1,000 if they do not follow the rules. 
Home Secretary Priti Patel said the laws are designed "to prevent a second wave" of coronavirus.
But some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules. 
Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete the form or enter quarantine.
There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.
All other travellers have to fill in a "public health passenger locator" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of £100, or travellers may be refused entry. 
If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. There will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed.
The government has faced criticism from the aviation industry and some Tory MPs over the measures, but Ms Patel said the measures were "proportionate" and being implemented "at the right time".
"The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a devastating second wave," Ms Patel said.
Those arriving in England could face a fine of £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a £480 fine in Scotland.
People should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. 
They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support.
Passengers in transit, who do not pass through border control, are also among the groups who are exempt from the mandatory isolation.
The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk.
The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.
British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government.
The airlines say they're prepared to ask for a judicial review into the government's travel quarantine rules. 
Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a "killer blow" to the tourism sector.
Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in May asking that the government avoid taking a "blanket approach" to quarantine, suggesting so-called "air bridges" with countries that have low coronavirus rates.
Aviation, maritime and rail industry leaders were invited to discuss the new quarantine plans but British Airways refused to attend the meeting, and aviation bosses told the BBC that they were not impressed by the content of the call. 
BBC's transport correspondent Tom Burridge says relations between the government and Britain's aviation industry are now at "rock bottom".
BA, already under huge financial strain due to the pandemic, is proposing to make 12,000 staff redundant in order to stay afloat. Separately, Heathrow Airport's chief executive has warned that about 25,000 jobs could be at risk at Heathrow Airport. 
Government sources have told the BBC that the UK is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore.
But the government's position is that the idea is only "under consideration".

On a Friday night more than thirty years ago, Sweden's prime minister went to the movies.
Controversial and outspoken at home and abroad, Olof Palme was by then in his second term as leader of his country. But he still insisted on living as normal a life as he could, and - as on that night - he often dismissed his police protection.
Walking home just before midnight with his wife Lisbet, the prime minister was shot in the back at point blank range. He was dead before he hit the ground.
No killer has ever been found, even though the assassination took place on Sweden's busiest road, and more than a dozen witnesses saw the tall man fire the shots before fleeing the scene. 
Now, more than 34 years later, Sweden's Prosecutor's Office has announced it will present the conclusions of its criminal investigation in a press conference scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
"I am optimistic about being able to present what happened with the murder and who is responsible for it," Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson told Swedish public television in February. 
It is not known if anyone will be charged, or if a new suspect will be named. But there is hope the police may finally be close to solving a murder that has haunted the country for decades, and spawned countless conspiracy theories.
"It's like if they murdered Margaret Thatcher at Piccadilly Circus - just gunned her down - and then the killer disappeared down into the Tube without ever being found," Dr Jan Bondeson, author of Blood on the Snow: The Killing of Olof Palme, told the BBC. 
Marten Palme, Olof's son and one of the last people to see him alive, said earlier this year that police "have evidence they do not yet want to disclose".
He thought it might be to do with the murder weapon, which has never been found. "If someone knows something important and has not come forward, it is obviously time to do it," he told Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper.
Born in 1927 to an upper class family with aristocratic connections, Palme joined the Social Democratic party in 1949 and rose to lead the party - and Sweden - in 1969, succeeding his mentor Tage Erlander. 
"Palme is said to be one of Erlander's boys," Anna Sundstrom, Secretary General of the Olof Palme International Center, told the BBC. "He was sort of raised as a politician by Tage Erlander, who is one of the fathers of the Swedish welfare system. I would say he took and advanced Erlander's policies." 
During his premiership, Palme increased the power of labour unions, greatly expanded health care and the welfare state, removed all formal political powers from the monarchy and invested heavily in education. Ms Sundstrom said one of the vital reforms was the creation of nurseries and pre-schools, allowing women to enter the work force for the first time and advancing gender equality in Sweden.
He was also a powerful voice in international affairs, criticising both the US and the Soviet Union. Palme passionately opposed the USSR's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in 1972 compared US bombing of North Vietnam with Nazi concentration camps during World War Two - prompting a brief freeze in relations between Washington and Stockholm.
"I don't regret it because in this world you have to speak out fairly loud to make anyone listen," he told the New York Times in 1973. "I can't keep silent on this issue and won't be pressurised into silence."
He called the racist apartheid order in South Africa "a particularly gruesome system" and funded the African National Congress, denounced Gen Franco's fascist regime in Spain as "goddamn murderers", and campaigned against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Palme also served as a mediator during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. 
His actions at home and abroad won him as many enemies as supporters. Business owners and liberals in Sweden were enraged by his reforms, while his loud and frequent criticisms of foreign governments infuriated leaders around the globe. 
"It was almost as if you either loved or hated him," Ms Sundstrom said. "There was a very, very strong resentment, not least on the right of politics. Nowadays when we talk about the strong rhetoric on social media against politicians, all of that we already saw in Sweden during Palme's era. They went after him extremely hard." 
"But also he was very well respected and loved in a big segment of the Swedish population," she said. People still come to lay flowers at the site where Palme died.
On the night of the murder - 28 February 1986 - Palme had already dismissed his guards when he got home and his wife suggested an impromptu cinema trip. Lisbet had spoken with their son Marten, who had bought tickets for a comedy film for himself and his girlfriend. 
Mr and Mrs Palme left their flat unaccompanied, took the subway from the old town to the centre and met their son and his partner outside the Grand Cinema at about 21:00.
The couples parted after the film, and Palme set off with Lisbet down Sveavagen - known as Sweden's busiest road. At the corner of Sveavagen and Tunnelgatan at 23:21, a tall man came up behind Palme and fired two shots  - one directly into the prime minister's back at point-blank range, and the other at Lisbet.
The killer then jogged down the road, climbed some stairs to an adjacent street, and disappeared.
Sweden was stunned. Charlotta Wallsten was just 12 years old at the time, but remembers her father telling her that something terrible had happened when she woke up. 
"We put on the TV and it was all about his assassination on an open street," she told the BBC. "The whole country was in shock."
Ms Wallsten remembers her school lighting a candle for Palme at a school assembly. "When he was murdered, the politics that you had weren't the most important thing... It was just shock. This didn't happen in Sweden."
Police seemed also to be in a state of shock. Officers did not properly cordon off the crime scene, and shut down too small an area of the city centre in the hours after the killer fled. 
Mourners went past the cordon to place flowers, walking where Palme's blood was still pooled on the ground. Witnesses were able to leave before they could be questioned. One of the bullets was not discovered until days later by a passerby.
Despite the large number of witnesses, police had few leads. 
The recovered bullets indicated the killer had used a .357 Magnum handgun - a "very powerful weapon," Dr Bondeson explained. "Even if he had worn a bulletproof vest he would have died. So the murder was done by someone who really wanted to kill him. It wasn't opportune, it was all planned."
The first chief investigator into the case pursued the idea that the Kurdish militant PKK had something to do with his murder. They were fighting a guerrilla campaign against Turkey and had recently been declared a terrorist group by Palme's government. 
But he was forced to resign in disgrace in 1987 after a raid on a bookshop - which served as a base for the organisation - garnered zero evidence about the murder.
In 1988 police arrested convicted criminal Christer Pettersson. He had killed a man on a Stockholm street with a bayonet in 1970 for seemingly no reason, and he matched the description of a person seen acting suspiciously near the cinema on the night Palme was killed. 
During a police line-up, Lisbet Palme identified Pettersson as the murderer. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1989. 
But his lawyer immediately appealed. Without motive or a murder weapon, the courts released him after just three months of his life sentence, and awarded him about $50,000 in compensation. Pettersson died in 2004 a free man.
Sweden's collective trauma and obsession with the assassination has spawned dozens of theories and even a term for the fixation - Palmes sjukdom, or Palme sickness.
A former South African police officer claimed in 1996 Palme was killed because of his stance against apartheid and for funding the ANC. Swedish investigators travelled there that year but could not find evidence to back up the claim, although some believe the old apartheid regime should still be considered a suspect. 
Stieg Larsson, author of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, spent years researching the murder and advanced this theory before his death in 2004.
Dr Bondeson, meanwhile, believes the murder was linked to arms deals with India. Swedish arms company Bofors had a deal to supply India with artillery in the 1980s and 1990s, but it was later revealed the company had bribed several middlemen in India for the contract - a scandal that implicated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
"It may well be that Palme found out that the Bofors company was corrupt the very day of the murder," he said. "That gives the middlemen behind the Bofors deal a strong reason to murder him. But that's something the police have always ignored."
Another possible lead is the so-called Skandia Man. Stig Engstrom - an employee at Skandia insurance company, headquartered near to the murder scene - was one of about 20 people to witness the assassination. He killed himself in 2000.

Police reportedly began investigating Engstrom in 2018. A 12-year investigation by Swedish journalist Thomas Pettersson first identified him as a suspect, alleging he had had weapons training and was friends with a man who owned a gun collection and had a fascination with Magnum revolvers. 
He was also shown to have lied about his time at the murder scene - claiming he tried to resuscitate the prime minister, which he had not.
"Many Swedes believe that Engstrom will be used as a scapegoat," Dr Bondeson said. "But he was a very short and insignificant looking person, whereas the murderer was tall and strong. And he never killed anybody before or after."
Ultimately, Dr Bondeson does not believe much will come of the announcement. "I think it will end up as a damp squib! But we will see."
"I don't expect anything, I don't expect clarity," Ms Sundstrom said. "But I think anyhow that it's important to close the case. You need in a way closure even though you don't have an answer."
On a Friday night more than thirty years ago, Sweden's prime minister went to the movies.
Controversial and outspoken at home and abroad, Olof Palme was by then in his second term as leader of his country. But he still insisted on living as normal a life as he could, and - as on that night - he often dismissed his police protection.
Walking home just before midnight with his wife Lisbet, the prime minister was shot in the back at point blank range. He was dead before he hit the ground.
No killer has ever been found, even though the assassination took place on Sweden's busiest road, and more than a dozen witnesses saw the tall man fire the shots before fleeing the scene. 
Now, more than 34 years later, Sweden's Prosecutor's Office has announced it will present the conclusions of its criminal investigation in a press conference scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
"I am optimistic about being able to present what happened with the murder and who is responsible for it," Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson told Swedish public television in February. 
It is not known if anyone will be charged, or if a new suspect will be named. But there is hope the police may finally be close to solving a murder that has haunted the country for decades, and spawned countless conspiracy theories.
"It's like if they murdered Margaret Thatcher at Piccadilly Circus - just gunned her down - and then the killer disappeared down into the Tube without ever being found," Dr Jan Bondeson, author of Blood on the Snow: The Killing of Olof Palme, told the BBC. 
Marten Palme, Olof's son and one of the last people to see him alive, said earlier this year that police "have evidence they do not yet want to disclose".
He thought it might be to do with the murder weapon, which has never been found. "If someone knows something important and has not come forward, it is obviously time to do it," he told Sweden's Aftonbladet newspaper.
Born in 1927 to an upper class family with aristocratic connections, Palme joined the Social Democratic party in 1949 and rose to lead the party - and Sweden - in 1969, succeeding his mentor Tage Erlander.

A slave trader's statue in Bristol has been torn down and thrown into the harbour during a second day of anti-racism protests across the UK.
It comes after largely peaceful demonstrations across the weekend saw some clashes with police.
On Sunday evening, police in central London issued a dispersal order for the City of Westminster compelling people to leave the area after skirmishes.
Boris Johnson tweeted that the protests had been "subverted by thuggery".
Thousands of protesters massed for a second day in London, as well as cities across the UK including Bristol, Manchester, Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
Protests were generally peaceful, with aerial footage showing thousands of demonstrators flooding the roads outside the US embassy in Vauxhall, south London, before marching towards Parliament Square and Downing Street.
But there were some disturbances, leading to 12 arrests in London - the majority for public order offences and one for criminal damage. Eight officers were injured, police said.
The Metropolitan Police's Superintendent Jo Edwards said following a "predominantly peaceful protest" in the capital, officers were faced with further "scenes of violence and disorder" which were "entirely unacceptable".
At around 20:00 BST, bottles were thrown at police and there were clashes near Parliament.  
The crowd shouted "no justice, no peace" as they moved down Whitehall and let off smoke bombs. 
As darkness fell, lines of police in riot gear took up positions to contain a small group of protesters in Westminster, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. 
A police officer received a head injury and a Section 35 dispersal order was issued until 06:00 on Monday.
The Prime Minister later tweeted: "People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account."
Earlier in the day, in Bristol, protesters used ropes to pull down the bronze statue of Edward Colston, a prominent 17th Century slave trader, who has been a source of controversy in the city for many years.
Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about 80,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas.
On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings.
After the statue was toppled, a protester was pictured with his knee on the figure's neck - reminiscent of the video showing George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer. 
The statue was later dragged through the streets of Bristol and thrown into the harbour. The empty plinth was used as a makeshift stage for protesters. 
Home Secretary Priti Patel called the tearing down of the statue "utterly disgraceful", adding that "it speaks to the acts of public disorder that have become a distraction from the cause people are protesting about".
"It's right the police follow up and make sure that justice is undertaken with those individuals that are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour," she said.
In a statement, Avon and Somerset pPolice confirmed there would be an investigation into the "act of criminal damage".
Historian Prof David Olusoga told BBC News that the statue should have been taken down long before.
He said: "Statues are about saying 'This was a great man who did great things.' That is not true, he [Colston] was a slave trader and a murderer."
In a statement the Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said he knew the removal of the statue would divide opinion but it was "important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity".
In Parliament Square, the statue of Sir Winston Churchill was sprayed with graffiti, and a Black Lives Matter sign attached - an act described as "stupid and counterproductive" by foreign office minister James Cleverly. 
And in Warwickshire, protesters caused the closure of the M6 for around an hour following on from the demonstrations in Coventry city centre.
It comes after clashes on Saturday night between police and protesters saw missiles and fireworks aimed at police and bikes thrown by some demonstrators.
The Metropolitan Police said 14 officers were injured, including a mounted officer who came off a horse as it bolted down Whitehall. 
Met Chief Dame Cressida Dick said she was "appalled" by the scenes of unrest on Saturday night, which led to 14 arrests. 
Ms Patel said there was "no excuse for violent behaviour" and said the protests should stop. 
However, speaking on Sunday morning, shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy backed the demonstrations, saying people "cannot be silent in the face of racism", but she urged protesters to take precautions and socially distance.
The Labour MP told the BBC's Andrew Marr she was "proud" of young people demanding change.
The New York Times' opinion editor has resigned amid outrage over a piece by a Republican senator calling for military forces to be sent to cities where anti-racism protests had turned violent.
James Bennet stepped down after Senator Tom Cotton's article "Send in the Troops" caused revolt in the newsroom.
It backed Donald Trump's threat to use troops to quell unrest.
The newspaper had initially stood by the publication but then said the article "did not meet" its standards.
The change in position came after an outcry from both the public and staff over the piece, published on the newspaper's website last Wednesday. Some journalists did not come into work on Thursday in protest.
Mr Bennet, who has been the opinion editor since 2016, later admitted that he had not read the piece before its publication. The Arkansas senator's article called for "an overwhelming show of force" against groups he described as "rioters".
Its publication happened as hundreds of thousands of people have been marching across the US in recent weeks against racism and police brutality. There have been violent incidents in some cities.
The demonstrations were sparked by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. Video showed him pinned to the floor, with a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes.
More than 800 employees signed a letter denouncing the article's publication, saying it contained misinformation.
"As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this," Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote on Twitter.
In a note to staff on Sunday, New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger said: "Last week we saw a significant breakdown in our editing processes, not the first we've experienced in recent years."
The note said Mr Bennet had resigned after he agreed that "it would take a new team to lead the department through a time of considerable change". There was no mention of Mr Cotton's piece.
The New York Times initially defended the article, saying the editorial page needed to reflect diverse viewpoints. But in a lengthy editor's note added to the text on Friday, it said the piece "fell short of our standards and should not have been published".
It said "the editing process was rushed and flawed", adding: "The published piece presents as facts assertions about the role of 'cadres of left-wing radicals like antifa'; in fact, those allegations have not been substantiated and have been widely questioned."
The newspaper also said the senator's statement that police officers "bore the brunt" of the violence seen in some cities was an "overstatement that should have been challenged". The headline, which had not been written by Mr Cotton, "was incendiary and should not have been used," the note added.
Mr Sulzberger's email announced that Jim Dao, who oversees op-eds as a deputy in the opinion section, will be moved to another role, while Katie Kingsbury will become acting opinion editorial page editor.
On Saturday, Stan Wischnowski, the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, resigned after publishing a headline that equated property damage to the deaths of black people, which prompted public condemnation from many of the newspaper's staff.
Mr Wischnowski apologised for what he described as a "horribly wrong" decision to use the headline "Buildings Matter Too" on an article about civil unrest in the US.
Huawei is launching a newspaper and internet campaign to mark 20 years of business in the UK.
In an open letter to the public, the Chinese telecoms company says it is "as committed as ever" to provide "the best equipment" to the UK's 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband providers.
It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit.
Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests.
The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei.
The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK had recently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter as "a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner". 
Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the "noise" surrounding the company.
He said he hoped the UK would take an "evidence and fact-based approach" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. 
"We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment," he said. "We don't have time to delay this."
Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market.
And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory.
In January, ministers announced that Huawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called "core" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system.
It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk.
But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China.
And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. 
In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. 
"We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry," Mr Zhang told the BBC. "We need to work out a solution."
Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. 
However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. 
NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G.
That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. 
That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower.
The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked.
"We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously," Mr Zhang said. 
The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday to have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should "surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood". 
Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. 
"We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong," he said.
"It is simply because of trade and protectionism." 
The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that stockpiles of medical supplies have been "used up entirely" by the coronavirus pandemic.
A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store "critical" medicines to treat the virus.
Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.
The government said "robust contingency plans are in place".
The spokesperson added: "We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade."
However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS.
The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be "less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. 
At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles.
"Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products," the memo says.
The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers.
At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight.
The memo was put together by an cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. 
If this happens, the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year.
The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to "international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing". 
As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: "We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries."
The pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestion at the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK.
As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of "critical products" where "supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period". 
The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. 
That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which "reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response" to the coronavirus crisis.
The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year.
But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. 
In a normal year, Christmas would be "the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels", the memo says.
The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. 
And it has requested "urgent clarity" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had "worked around the clock" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up.
"With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship," said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett.
In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. 
"But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical," he stressed. 
A British man who fell into a well on the Indonesian island of Bali has been rescued after six days.
Jacob Roberts, 29, broke his leg after falling into the 4m-deep well in Pecatu village while being chased by a dog, said AFP quoting local authorities. 
The well was dry but his leg meant he was unable to get out. Witnesses say there was a small amount of water in the well which likely kept him alive. 
Mr Roberts' cries for help were eventually heard by a local resident. 
The resident had been looking for cattle feed near the area, which was in an isolated part of the village, said news outlet the Bali Sun. He alerted the local authorities. 
"He looked thin and injured," South Kuta police chief Yusak Agustinus Sooai said of Mr Roberts' condition when he was found on Saturday. 
Local search and rescue chief Gede Darmada said Mr Roberts was lifted out of the well in a stretcher by three men, according to the local search and rescue agency, Basarnas Bali. 
In a statement on Instagram, Basarnas said that Mr Roberts was taken to the BIMC Nusa Dua hospital.
Pecatu village, located in northern Bali, is near the popular tourist hotspot of Nusa Dua.
It wasn't clear whether Mr Roberts was a resident or a tourist in Bali.
Bali has been on lockdown for months due to the virus outbreak, though several places have now began cautiously re-opening.
A single coal mine in Poland's Upper Silesia region is behind a record spike in the country's confirmed coronavirus cases, the health ministry says.
Over the weekend 1,151 new infections were recorded nationally.
An outbreak among miners and their families at the Zofiowka colliery in southern Poland accounted for two-thirds of that figure. 
The global number of deaths from coronavirus has now passed 400,000. There have been 6.9 million infections. 
Poland introduced a strict lockdown early in March, and has avoided the comparatively large number of deaths seen in Western Europe.
In Poland, 1,157 people have died from Covid-19 and 26,561 have been infected but the stubborn persistence of cases in Upper Silesia mean the country has not passed its peak.
Most EU countries recorded fewer new cases than Poland on Sunday.
Upper Silesia is Poland's industrial heartland with more than a dozen active mines where workers toil in humid conditions at close quarters.
More than 4,000 people in the region have tested positive for the virus. Of Sunday's new infections, 57% were recorded in Upper Silesia. 
Coal company JSW says it has  reduced output at a mine in Pniowek, and PGG, another company, closed some mines temporarily in May, reports Reuters.
Despite the persistent infections in Upper Silesia, Poland began to ease restrictions on 20 April when parks were allowed to reopen. Some school children returned to school at the end of May.
The spread of infection in confined workplaces has also been seen in mines and factories in South Africa and the US.
Operations at  South Africa's Mponeng mine, the world's deepest gold mine, were halted after 164 cases of coronavirus were detected there in late May.
In the US, there have been 20,400 infections in 216 meat processing factories and at least 74 people have died, according to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

George Floyd, the black man killed in police custody in the US, has become a rallying cry for equality and justice in some of the largest protests against racism since the 1960s.
Protestors have chanted his name for 13 days and his face has been painted in murals from Syria to Belfast.
But other names too have been on the lips of protesters, in particular that of Breonna Taylor, a health worker shot eight times by police who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on 13 March.
Activists are calling on people to "Say Her Name" as part of a movement to remember black women who have not attracted the same attention as other cases.
On Friday, when Ms Taylor would have turned 27, mourners gathered for a vigil in Louisville and people shared birthday messages on social media writing, "you should have been here to celebrate".
 Yesterday, after three full days of work on #BirthdayForBreonna, I finally found some time to sit and write my birthday card for her. My family got involved and even my little cousin signed her name to her dad's card. This effort has ballooned into something I could never have imagined or hoped for. The work I put in and the work you all put in with me has been incredible to behold. So many of you sent beautiful cards and letters and postcards and you donated and you signed and you made this story big enough that I spent most of yesterday giving interviews. Seeing this project go so, immensely viral  had given me a new hope that perhaps we can value black women, even though we shouldn't need so much prompting. I hope that with all the time and effort and money that so many hundreds of you put in, we can finally get #JusticeForBreonna. Happy birthday Breonna. You should have been here to celebrate 🎉🎊 #SayHerName 🎨: @aylasydney and @_afrodiziak

"It started off lonely, but it's so amazing to see so many people standing up for her, just saying her name," her mother Tamika Palmer, said at the vigil.
Ms Taylor would have been out in the Black Lives Matter protests if she hadn't been killed, her mother added.
The events of the night Ms Taylor died are disputed.
Breonna Taylor, an emergency medical technician, was at home in bed in Louisville when police officers entered her apartment shortly after midnight. She died after being shot eight times.
They raided her address using a battering ram when executing a search warrant as part of a drugs investigation. No drugs were found on the property.
Local media report that police were acting on a "no-knock" warrant, allowing them to enter the home without warning. Police say despite the warrant, they knocked before entering but Ms Taylor's family and a neighbour have disputed this. 
The police had the wrong address,  a wrongful death lawsuit filed by her family claims.
Ms Taylor was asleep and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who has a gun licence, grabbed his firearm, according to the suit. 
Mr Walker believed people were breaking in and he fired in self-defence, his lawyer said.  
Mr Walker called 911 and said that "somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend," according to a recording released last week.
Louisville police said they returned fire after one officer was shot and wounded in the incident. 
In May Ms Taylor's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit that accuses the officers of battery, wrongful death, excessive force, negligence and gross negligence.
It says the officers were not looking for Ms Taylor or her partner - but for an unrelated suspect who was already in custody and did not live in the apartment complex.
The search warrant obtained by police included Ms Taylor's house because authorities believed a suspect in a drug ring used her apartment to hide drugs, according to a CNN news affiliate.
A lawyer for Ms Taylor's family, Ben Crump, described the incident as a "botched police raid."
An investigation into the circumstances of her death opened by the FBI on 21 May is ongoing, according to CNN.
Three officers have been placed on administrative leave, but no-one has been charged.
The officers who entered Ms Taylor's apartment were not wearing body cameras that could record the unfolding events.
Now, the Louisville police department says all officers must wear body cameras.
"No-knock" search warrants have been temporarily suspended. 
And the Louisville police chief was removed from his post when it was discovered that officers present at the fatal shooting of a black man during a protest did not have their body cams turned on.
People expressing their sadness, horror and anger about racism in the US have been sharing pictures of Ms Taylor on social media. More than five million people, including singer Janelle Monáe, have signed a petition calling for justice.
Many drew attention to stark statistics about the huge inequalities African-American women live with. 
Black women are three times more likely than white women to die in pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
They also experience significant pay disparity - in 2017 black women earned 61 cents for every dollar earned by white men, according to the Centre for American Progress.
As demands for racial equality continue, many want Breonna Taylor's name to be remembered.

Since the video depicting a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck went viral, it has been near impossible to escape it. 
But I, a black woman, made the decision that this time I wasn't going to watch the video. 
It is mentally and physically draining for me to watch yet another unarmed black man dying under arrest at the hands of another white police officer.
I know there will be plenty of people telling me I should be glad the video went viral because it unveiled the truth - a deep social and systemic problem that has been ongoing for centuries in the US. As a journalist, what could be more important to me than getting to the truth? 
But over the years I have found there is a fine line between exposing these horrific acts and safeguarding my mental health, especially when the story is so deeply rooted in my own experience.
I think anyone watching these videos will find them distressing, but it resonates on a completely different level for a black person like me; these images can act as traumatic triggers. 
When I spoke to Nia Dumas, a 20-year-old African-American woman living in the US, she told me she could not stop crying after watching George Floyd's last moments. 
"I have found myself crying sometimes four times a day since watching it," she said. "It has been very traumatic." 
Nia lives in Cleveland, Ohio, where she has seen a lot of violence. Growing up, images of black people being killed were almost constant in her life. 
"If it's not George Floyd, then it's someone else. It's just too much," she said.
"For me, seeing his video triggered memories of when Trayvon Martin was killed. I was around 11 years old then and it's crazy how I've been seeing stuff like this for years. I'm tired of it."
Trayvon Martin was an unarmed black 17-year-old, shot dead by a Florida neighbourhood watchman, who was cleared of any wrongdoing in 2012 on the grounds of self-defence. 
It was Trayvon's killing that brought about the first use of the Black Lives Matter hashtag.
Since then, that hashtag has been used many times over, as Toni Adepegba, a 27-year-old black British man, told me when we spoke about racism and its impact on mental health. 
"It's been a heavy month," he said, "only weeks since the video of Ahmaud Arbery's video surfaced. I had barely recovered from seeing the images of Ahmaud's killing and then I saw it happening again."
Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was jogging when he was shot dead during a confrontation with a father and son in the US state of Georgia.
For Toni, watching George Floyd's final moments was almost too much to take in. 
"I don't have the words to describe that feeling. I just felt broken. I just felt tired because these men could have been me."
Earlier the same day, he had watched another viral video of a white New York woman in Central Park, who was calling the police for help after a black man, a bird watcher, asked her to put her dog on a leash, in line with the park's rules.
"This was triggering for me," Toni said, "because it exposed the dynamics at play; she was aware of the privilege that she had as a white woman over a black man.
"She knew that she could get this man arrested or even killed with one phone call."
Toni could not watch the full video of George Floyd. 
"My first thought when I saw it was, 'Why are people just standing there?' But maybe they understood that they could easily be where he was."
In recent weeks, I have had numerous conversations about whether there is any benefit in sharing these images on social media.
Paris-born Laëtitia Kandolo is a 28-year-old black woman whose family comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
She struggled to watch the George Floyd video at first. 
"There were so many emotions to process. But a couple of hours later when it was just blowing up, I went back to watching. He was completely helpless, and I identified with that helplessness."
"We have to find a way to hold racists to account," says Laëtitia. "If these videos, make those who are privileged because of their skin colour to stop and think, then so be it." 
But she added, "It's important to remember that [white people] are watching the video, whereas we are living it - this is our reality." 
For many black people, seeing this video shared by non-black people brings up the question of authenticity.
Nia, from the US, is sceptical about the support she sees online, if deeper issues such as white privilege and institutional racism are not addressed. 
"I have seen a lot of predominantly white celebrities sharing ready-made posts, which I think is kind of artificial," she said. 
She has seen people who genuinely want to be supportive, which she appreciates. But she is not going to "applaud a fish for swimming". 
"I want to know how you feel, what you think as an individual, or what you contribute to the conversation, We've normalised the thinking that sharing a post, video or retweeting is showing support... We are beyond that now."
When black people come across such videos, they inevitably see themselves, or their families and their ancestors, behind a hashtag.  
"I was doing a lot of running at night when Ahmaud's video came out," Toni said.
"It dawned on me the high likelihood that someone could see me running and just call the police with the assumption that I'm running away from a crime scene. It still plays on my mind that if I was in America, I could have been him."
"Every black person has a moment", Laëtitia said, "when they realise they are black and what that means to the world at large."
For her, it was a conversation she had with her father when she was 18 and wanted to go to fashion school. 
"He told me, 'You're black and as a black person in an artistic sphere you will struggle, you will have to worker harder than everyone one else to be seen.' I felt crushed. I cried." 
Black people from around the world know too well that the experience of racism ranges from the extremes to the daily micro-aggressions, all rooted in the same history.
In my case, growing up as an African in multicultural east London, I felt somewhat cushioned from blatant racism at first, but once I left for university to study journalism, I also had to deal with the "real world". 
My afro became a topic of conversation. It went from "sassy hair" to "a mane" to being told that I had "moppish hair" - which could hinder my career.  
The trauma that racist videos and images trigger in black people is linked to many such memories, either personal ones, or collectively shared.
"I think we are realising more than ever that George Floyd's story is also my story. We are connected and are part of a broader story," said Laëtitia.
"These images have historical significance and weight for black people; from the images of lynching to the mutilation of hands in Belgian Congo, these pictures are traumatic. They've been trying to kill us, but we're still here fighting to live."
But these images can become exhausting for a black person, to the point that it may be damaging their mental health.
I've felt the overwhelming pressure to continuously read, share, post and actively engage with everything on my social media feed about the latest hashtag on a racist killing, until George Floyd's video came up, when I made a conscious effort to protect myself. 
Toni said he also had to find a balance between engaging with the conversations about racism and protecting his mental health.
"There is a need to ensure that George Floyd is not forgotten." he said.
"But I've been saying this to other black people, that they shouldn't feel pressured to see these images or share them. Your mental health is your priority.
"It's not a black versus white thing, it's a humanity thing. I believe change can only happen when it stops being 'their' problem, and becomes 'our' problem."

"This was triggering for me," Toni said, "because it exposed the dynamics at play; she was aware of the privilege that she had as a white woman over a black man.
"She knew that she could get this man arrested or even killed with one phone call."
Toni could not watch the full video of George Floyd. 
"My first thought when I saw it was, 'Why are people just standing there?' But maybe they understood that they could easily be where he was."
In recent weeks, I have had numerous conversations about whether there is any benefit in sharing these images on social media.
Paris-born Laëtitia Kandolo is a 28-year-old black woman whose family comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
She struggled to watch the George Floyd video at first. 
"There were so many emotions to process. But a couple of hours later when it was just blowing up, I went back to watching. He was completely helpless, and I identified with that helplessness."
"We have to find a way to hold racists to account," says Laëtitia. "If these videos, make those who are privileged because of their skin colour to stop and think, then so be it." 
But she added, "It's important to remember that [white people] are watching the video, whereas we are living it - this is our reality." 
For many black people, seeing this video shared by non-black people brings up the question of authenticity.
Nia, from the US, is sceptical about the support she sees online, if deeper issues such as white privilege and institutional racism are not addressed. 
"I have seen a lot of predominantly white celebrities sharing ready-made posts, which I think is kind of artificial," she said. 
She has seen people who genuinely want to be supportive, which she appreciates. But she is not going to "applaud a fish for swimming". 
"I want to know how you feel, what you think as an individual, or what you contribute to the conversation, We've normalised the thinking that sharing a post, video or retweeting is showing support... We are beyond that now."
When black people come across such videos, they inevitably see themselves, or their families and their ancestors, behind a hashtag.  
"I was doing a lot of running at night when Ahmaud's video came out," Toni said.
"It dawned on me the high likelihood that someone could see me running and just call the police with the assumption that I'm running away from a crime scene. It still plays on my mind that if I was in America, I could have been him."
"Every black person has a moment", Laëtitia said, "when they realise they are black and what that means to the world at large."
For her, it was a conversation she had with her father when she was 18 and wanted to go to fashion school. 
"He told me, 'You're black and as a black person in an artistic sphere you will struggle, you will have to worker harder than everyone one else to be seen.' I felt crushed. I cried." 
Black people from around the world know too well that the experience of racism ranges from the extremes to the daily micro-aggressions, all rooted in the same history.
In my case, growing up as an African in multicultural east London, I felt somewhat cushioned from blatant racism at first, but once I left for university to study journalism, I also had to deal with the "real world". 
My afro became a topic of conversation. It went from "sassy hair" to "a mane" to being told that I had "moppish hair" - which could hinder my career.  
The trauma that racist videos and images trigger in black people is linked to many such memories, either personal ones, or collectively shared.
"I think we are realising more than ever that George Floyd's story is also my story. We are connected and are part of a broader story," said Laëtitia.
"These images have historical significance and weight for black people; from the images of lynching to the mutilation of hands in Belgian Congo, these pictures are traumatic. They've been trying to kill us, but we're still here fighting to live."
But these images can become exhausting for a black person, to the point that it may be damaging their mental health.
I've felt the overwhelming pressure to continuously read, share, post and actively engage with everything on my social media feed about the latest hashtag on a racist killing, until George Floyd's video came up, when I made a conscious effort to protect myself. 
Toni said he also had to find a balance between engaging with the conversations about racism and protecting his mental health.
"There is a need to ensure that George Floyd is not forgotten." he said.
"But I've been saying this to other black people, that they shouldn't feel pressured to see these images or share them. Your mental health is your priority.
"It's not a black versus white thing, it's a humanity thing. I believe change can only happen when it stops being 'their' problem, and becomes 'our' problem." 
Since the video depicting a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck went viral, it has been near impossible to escape it. 
But I, a black woman, made the decision that this time I wasn't going to watch the video. 
It is mentally and physically draining for me to watch yet another unarmed black man dying under arrest at the hands of another white police officer.
I know there will be plenty of people telling me I should be glad the video went viral because it unveiled the truth - a deep social and systemic problem that has been ongoing for centuries in the US. As a journalist, what could be more important to me than getting to the truth? 
But over the years I have found there is a fine line between exposing these horrific acts and safeguarding my mental health, especially when the story is so deeply rooted in my own experience.
I think anyone watching these videos will find them distressing, but it resonates on a completely different level for a black person like me; these images can act as traumatic triggers. 
When I spoke to Nia Dumas, a 20-year-old African-American woman living in the US, she told me she could not stop crying after watching George Floyd's last moments. 
"I have found myself crying sometimes four times a day since watching it," she said. "It has been very traumatic." 
Nia lives in Cleveland, Ohio, where she has seen a lot of violence. Growing up, images of black people being killed were almost constant in her life. 
"If it's not George Floyd, then it's someone else. It's just too much," she said.
"For me, seeing his video triggered memories of when Trayvon Martin was killed. I was around 11 years old then and it's crazy how I've been seeing stuff like this for years. I'm tired of it."
Trayvon Martin was an unarmed black 17-year-old, shot dead by a Florida neighbourhood watchman, who was cleared of any wrongdoing in 2012 on the grounds of self-defence. 
It was Trayvon's killing that brought about the first use of the Black Lives Matter hashtag.
Since then, that hashtag has been used many times over, as Toni Adepegba, a 27-year-old black British man, told me when we spoke about racism and its impact on mental health. 
"It's been a heavy month," he said, "only weeks since the video of Ahmaud Arbery's video surfaced. I had barely recovered from seeing the images of Ahmaud's killing and then I saw it happening again."
Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was jogging when he was shot dead during a confrontation with a father and son in the US state of Georgia.
For Toni, watching George Floyd's final moments was almost too much to take in. 
"I don't have the words to describe that feeling. I just felt broken. I just felt tired because these men could have been me."
